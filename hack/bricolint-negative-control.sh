# Negative control for the bricolint hand-drawn-UI guard.
#
# A green `go vet -vettool=bricolint` only proves the guard is SILENT on this
# tree; it does not prove the guard can still BITE. A guard that never fires
# (wrong receiver-type resolution, an analyzer that no-ops, a stale binary)
# would pass CI while protecting nothing. This script proves the guard is
# live by driving it through the full state machine:
#
#   1. clean tree                      -> bricolint exits 0
#   2. inject a raw painter draw call  -> bricolint exits non-zero
#   3. remove the injection            -> bricolint exits 0
#
# The injection is a genuine drawing primitive (`FillRect`) called on the
# real *painter.PixelPainter that scene.go's draw() constructs — the exact
# leak the guard exists to catch — so a pass here means the guard bites on
# THIS app's own render path, not on a synthetic fixture.
#
# Usage:
#   BRICOLINT=/path/to/bricolint bash hack/bricolint-negative-control.sh
# BRICOLINT defaults to "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/bricolint".
